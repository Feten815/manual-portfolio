# Manual Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my manual QA testing portfolio!  
I'm an ISTQB-certified junior QA tester working to improve my skills by testing real websites and documenting my work.

## 🛍️ Project: Mytek.tn (Tunisian E-commerce Website)

### ✅ Test Cases:
- `Mytek_Search_TestCases.docx` – 6 test cases for search, cart, and checkout

### 🐞 Bug Reports:
- `BUG-001_Mytek_Search_CaseSensitivity.docx` – Search does not work with lowercase letters

💼 Goal: Learn by doing and become job-ready as a QA Tester.
